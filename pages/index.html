        Cincinnati (/ˌsɪnsɪˈnæti/ ⓘ SIN-sih-NAT-ee; colloquially nicknamed
        Cincy) is a city in Hamilton County, Ohio, United States, and its county
        seat.[10] Settled in 1788, the city is located on the northern side of
        the confluence of the Licking and Ohio rivers, the latter of which marks
        the state line with Kentucky. The third-most populous city in Ohio with
        a population of 309,317 at the 2020 census, Cincinnati serves as the
        economic and cultural hub of the tri-state Cincinnati metropolitan area,
        Ohio's most populous metropolitan area and the nation's 30th-largest at
        over 2.3 million residents.[11]

        Throughout much of the 19th century, Cincinnati was among the top 10
        U.S. cities by population. The city developed as a river town for cargo
        shipping by steamboats, located at the crossroads of the Northern and
        Southern United States, with fewer immigrants and less influence from
        Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a
        significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of
        the city's cultural institutions. It later developed an industrialized
        economy in manufacturing. Many structures in the urban core have
        remained intact for 200 years; in the late 1800s, Cincinnati was
        commonly referred to as the "Paris of America" due mainly to ambitious
        architectural projects such as the Music Hall, Cincinnatian Hotel, and
        the Roebling Bridge.[12]
